# TTS (Text-to-Speech) Guide

My Translator can **read translations aloud** as they appear — like having a personal interpreter. Three providers available:

## Provider Comparison

|-|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Cost** | Free | Free 1M chars/mo, then $30/1M | ~$5–$22/month |
| **Quality** | Natural, clear | Near-human, expressive | Very natural, expressive |
| **Vietnamese** | ✅ HoaiMy, NamMinh | ✅ 6 voices (Aoede, Kore, Charon...) | ✅ Yes |
| **Setup** | None — works instantly | Google Cloud API key | ElevenLabs API key |
| **Speed control** | ✅ -50% to +100% | ✅ 0.5x to 2.0x | ❌ |
| **Latency** | ~300-500ms | ~200-500ms | ~500-800ms |

## How to Use TTS

1. **Toggle TTS**: Click the **TTS** button on the toolbar or press `⌘ T`
2. TTS is **OFF by default** on each app launch — you must enable it each session
3. When enabled, translations are read aloud as they appear
4. Switch providers anytime in Settings → TTS

> **Two-way mode**: TTS is automatically disabled when using two-way translation. This prevents audio feedback loops where TTS output gets recaptured by the microphone and re-translated. The TTS button will appear grayed out in two-way mode.

## Troubleshooting

- **No sound?** Check the TTS button (🔊) is active and system volume is up
- **Edge TTS not working?** Check your internet connection
- **Google TTS error?** Verify your API key is correct and Text-to-Speech API is enabled
- **TTS voice getting re-transcribed?** Lower TTS volume or pause transcription while TTS is speaking
